Introduction\\nThe variations of wind speed, in a certain site, are strictly related to the\\neconomic aspects of a wind farm, such as maintenance operations, especially\\nPreprint submitted to Renewable Energy May 17, 2013\\nar\\nX\\niv\\n:1\\n30\\n5.\\n36\\n96\\nv1\\n  [\\nph\\nys\\nics\\n.da\\nta-\\nan\\n]  \\n16\\n M\\nay\\n 20\\n13\\nin the off shore farms, pitch angle control on new wind turbines and evalua-\\ntion of a new site. Many researchers are working proposing new models that\\ncan allow the prediction of wind speed, minutes, hours or days ahead. Many\\nof these models are based on neural networks [1, 2], autoregressive models\\n[3, 4, 5], Markov chains [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], hybrid models where the previous\\nmentioned models are combined [12, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,\\n23, 24] and other less used models [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. Often, these models\\nare either focused on specific time scale forecasting, or synthetic time series\\ngeneration. Instead, our model can be used both for time series generation\\nand for forecasting at different time scales.\\nThe approach we propose here is based on indexed semi-Markov chain\\n(ISMC) model that was advanced by the same authors in [31] and applied to\\nthe generation of synthetic wind speed time series. In [31] we showed that our\\nmodel is able to reproduce correctly the statistical behavior of wind speed.\\nThe ISMC model is a nonparametric model because it does not require any\\nassumption on the form of the distribution function of wind speed. In this\\nwork we use the same model, slightly modified by adding a daily deterministic\\ncomponent, to forecast future values of wind speed. We will show that this\\nmodel performs better than a simple persistence model, by comparing the\\nroot mean square errors. The ISMC model is able to forecast wind speed\\nat different time scale without loosing the goodness of forecasting which\\nis almost independent from the time horizon. Another important aspect\\naddressed by this work is the number of data needed to have a good forecast.\\nWith this aim we will show the root mean square error as a function of the\\ndata used to calibrate the model.\\nThe paper is organized as follows. First of all, in Section 2, we describe\\nthe database used for the analysis. In Section 3, we present the model and its\\nvalidation. Then, in Section 4, we present results of the wind speed forecast-\\ning through an indicator of goodness and comparison with the persistence\\nmodel. Finally in Section 5 we present some concluding remarks.\\n2. Database\\nThe database used for the analysis in this work is freely available from\\n[37] and is composed of more than 230000 data of wind speed collected every\\n10 minutes. The weather station of L.S.I. -Lastem is situated in Italy at N\\n45 28’ 14,9” − E 9 22’ 19,9” and at 107 m of altitude. The station uses a\\ncombined speed-direction anemometer at 22 m above the ground. It has a\\n2\\n0 2 4 6 8\\n0\\n0.05\\n0.1\\nv [m/s]\\nFr\\neq\\nue\\nnc\\ny\\n25/10/2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 28/11/2011\\n4\\n8\\n12\\n16\\nTime\\nW\\nind\\n sp\\nee\\nd \\n[m\\n/s]\\nFigure 1: Database and its probability density distribution.\\nmeasurement range that goes from 0 to 60 m/s, a threshold of 0,38 m/s and\\na resolution of 0,05 m/s. The database and its empirical probability density\\nfunction are represented in Figure 1. We discretized wind speed into 8 states\\n(see Table 1) chosen to cover all the wind speed distribution. Table 1 shows\\nthe wind speed states with their related wind speed values.\\nIn order to analyze the behavior at different time scales, we resampled\\nthe data at different sampling frequencies: namely 30 minutes, 1 hour and 2\\nhours.\\n3. Model\\n3.1. The indexed semi-Markov chain model\\nThe general formulation of the ISMC as developed in references [32], [33],\\n[34] and [31] is here discussed informally.\\n3\\nSate Wind speed range m/s\\n1 0 to 1\\n2 1 - 2\\n3 2 - 3\\n4 3 - 4\\n5 4 - 5\\n6 5 - 6\\n7 6 - 7\\n8 >7\\nTable 1: Wind speed discretization\\nSemi-Markov processes have similar idea as those that generate Markov\\nprocesses. The processes are both described by a set of finite states vn whose\\ntransitions are ruled by a transition probability matrix. The semi-Markov\\nprocess differs from the Markov process because the transition times Tn are\\ngenerated according to random variables. Indeed, the time between transi-\\ntions Tn+1 − Tn is random and may be modeled by means of any type of\\ndistribution functions. In studies concerning wind speed modeling the states\\nvn indicates discretized wind speed at the nth transition and Tn the time in\\nwhich the nth change of wind speed occurs.\\nIn [35, 36], different semi-Markov models were applied to the wind speed\\nmodeling and it was shown that the semi-Markov models over perform the\\nMarkov models and therefore they are to be preferred in the modeling of\\nwind speed to Markovian models.\\nIn order to better represent the statistical characteristics of wind speed,\\nin a recent article, the idea of an ISMC was advanced in the field of wind\\nspeed, see [31]. The novelty, with respect to the semi-Markov case, consists\\nin the introduction of a third random variable defined as follow:\\nUmn =\\nm∑\\nk=0\\nvn−1−k · Tn−k − Tn−1−k\\nTn − Tn−1−m . (1)\\nThis variable can be interpreted as a moving average of order m+1 executed\\non the series of the past wind speed values (vn−1−k) with weights given by the\\nfractions of sojourn times in that wind speed (Tn−k − Tn−1−k) with respect\\nto the interval time on which the average is executed (Tn − Tn−1−m). Also\\n4\\nSate Um range m/s\\n1 0 to 2.1\\n2 2.1 - 2.6\\n3 2.6 - 3.4\\n4 3.4 - 6\\n5 >6\\nTable 2: Um processes discretization\\nthe process Um has been discretized, Table 2 shows the states of the process\\nand their values.\\nThe parametermmust be optimized as a function of the specific database.\\nThe optimization is made by finding the value of m that realize the minimum\\nof the root mean square error (RMSE) between the autocorrelation functions\\n(ACF) of real and simulated data, see [31]. In our analysis m = 7.\\nThe reasons to introduce this index of memory are found in the presence\\nof a strong autocorrelation that characterize the wind speed process. In the\\nsame work we have shown that if a too small memory is used, the autocor-\\nrelation is already persistent but decreases faster than real data. With a\\nlonger memory the autocorrelation remain high for a very long period and\\nalso its value is very close to that of real data. If m is increased further the\\nautocorrelation drops again to small values. This behavior suggests the exis-\\ntence of an optimal memory m. In our opinion one can justify this behavior\\nby saying that short memories are not enough to identify in which status\\n(low, medium low, medium, medium high, high, see Table 2) is the index\\nUm, too long memories mix together different status and then much of the\\ninformation is lost in the average.\\nThe one step transition probability matrix can be evaluated by consid-\\nering the counting transition between the three random variables considered\\nbefore. Then, the probability pi,j(t, u) represents the transition probability\\nfrom the actual wind speed state i, to the wind speed state j, given that the\\nsojourn time spent in the state i is equal to t and the value of the process\\nUm is u. These probabilities can be computed as:\\npi,j(t, u) =\\nni,j(t, u)∑\\nj\\nni,j(t, u)\\n, (2)\\n5\\nwhere nij(t, u) is the total number of transitions observed in the database\\nfrom state i to state j in next period having a sojourn time spent in the wind\\nspeed i equal to t and the value of the index process equal to u.\\nThe ISMC model revealed to be particularly efficient in reproducing to-\\ngether the probability density function of wind speed and the autocorrelation\\nfunction, see [31].\\n3.2. Deterministic wind speed component\\nThe speed of wind shows a diurnal behavior due to the alternation be-\\ntween night and day. In Figure 2, in which are plotted the ACF of real and\\nsimulated data, it is possible to note this sinusoidal trend (see Section 3.4\\nfor a better explanation of the figure). To model this seasonality we add a\\ndeterministic component given by a sine wave to the indexed semi-Markov\\nmodel:\\nvd = A · sin\\n(\\n2pi\\n24\\nh\\n)\\nh = 1, 2, ..., n. (3)\\nThe value of the parameter A has to be optimized according to the database\\nused for the analysis. In our case A = 0.41 and it has been obtained by\\nminimizing the RMSE between the ACF of real and synthetic data by using\\na genetic algorithm.\\n3.3. Transition probability matrix\\nWe computed the transition probability matrix by using equation (2)\\nto the wind speed database. Two examples of the estimated matrices are\\ngiven in Tables 3 and 4. As described above, in the model the transition\\nmatrix do depend from initial and arrival states but also from the sojourn\\ntime and the value of the random variable U. In the example given here we\\nshow the transition matrices for Um = 2 and t = 2 and for Um = 4 and\\nt = 2 respectively, evaluated from the original database with the sampling\\nfrequency of 10 minutes.\\nA first comparison between Table 3 and Table 4 reveals that the value of\\nthe index process affects seriously the transition probability to the next wind\\nspeed value. As a matter of example if i = 1, t = 2, Umn = 2, the probability\\nto have a wind speed j = 1 in next period is equal to 0.7065, see Table 3. On\\nthe contrary, if i = 1, t = 2, Umn = 4, the probability to have a wind speed\\nj = 1 in next period becomes 0.4900, see Table 4. The differences in the one\\nstep transition probabilities are significant and confirm the hypothesis that\\nnext wind speed depends also on the value of the index process.

Model validation\\nWe compute the ACF of real and synthetic data in order to assess the\\nability of the model to reproduce statistical properties of real wind speed\\ndata. We generate a synthetic time series by means of Monte Carlo simula-\\ntion. The specific algorithm used for the generation of the trajectory can be\\nfound in [31]. If v indicates wind speed, the time lagged (τ) autocorrelation\\nof wind speed is defined as:\\nΣ(τ) =\\nCov(v(t+ τ), v(t))\\nV ar(v(t))\\n.

The ACF\\nof real and the synthetic data are plotted in Figure 2. As it is possible to\\nnote, the ACF has a sinusoidal trend with a period of 24 hours. This behavior\\nis reproduced by our model with the introduction of the deterministic wind\\nspeed component evaluated by the equation (3.2). To asses the differences\\nbetween the ACF of real and synthetic data we used the root mean square\\nerror (RMSE) which is defined as follows:\\nRMSE =\\n√√√√ 1\\nn\\nn∑\\ni=1\\n(vri − vsi )2,\\nwhere vr and vs represent real data and synthetic one respectively, while n\\nis the length of the two series. For the ACF plotted in Figure 2 we obtained\\na RMSE equal to 0.0223.\\n4. Results\\n4.1. Wind speed forecasting\\nIn this section the ISMC model is used to forecast future wind speed\\nstates by using a one step ahead forecasting procedure, for different time\\n8\\nhorizons and for various time scales. Particularly, we tested our model using\\nthe previously described databases with a sampling frequency of 10 minutes,\\n30 minutes, 1 hour and 2 hours.\\nFor each one of the sampling frequencies, the database is divided into two\\nsubsets: the first part is used to find the transition probability matrix (as\\ndescribed in the previous section), we will call this part the setting period;\\nthe second part is used to compare the model forecasting with real data\\n(called testing period). As a first attempt to verify the model performance,\\nwe used two years of data as setting period and one year as testing. We will\\nshow in the paragraph 4.2 how to find the best setting period. Once the\\ntransition matrix is set, the forecasted states are computed as follows:\\nvf =\\nk∑\\nj=1\\nj pi,j(t, u), (5)\\nwhere k is the number of states in which wind speed is discretized and pi,j(t, u)\\nis the transition probability matrix. The formula represents the expected\\nvalue of the next transition given that the present wind speed value is i, the\\nsojourn time spent in the state i is equal to t and the value of the index\\nprocess Um is u.\\nIn Figure 3 we show the results obtained using our model for the four\\ndifferent time scales. In the figure the black continuous line represents real\\ndata while the dashed red line is the predicted series. In this figure the\\npredicted series are long 100 time horizon (specific time depending on the\\nsampling frequency).\\nAlready from this figure, it is possible to note that the goodness of the\\nprediction does not fall down at the increasing of the length of the forecasted\\nseries. To better verify this point, in Table 5 we show quantitative results of\\nour forecasting model for all the considered time scales and for different time\\nhorizons. Particularly, we show mean and standard deviation of the RMSE\\nbetween real and predicted data tested on 50 different forecasted series. Table\\n5 shows that the goodness of prediction remains almost constant even varying\\ntime scales and time horizons.\\nWe compare our model with a simple persistence model. This simple\\nmethod is often used, still today, in industry for its simplicity and for its\\nefficiency for very short-term predictions. It assumes that the wind speed at\\ntime t + ∆t is equal to the wind speed at time t. Commonly this method\\nis used to compare the behavior of new forecasting models [38].

The persistence model do not change its goodness of forecasting at\\nvarying of the time horizon. Then we compare our results with the persistence\\nmodel at different time scales. For the frequency of 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1\\nhour and 2 hours we have respectively an RMSE between the true series and\\nthe forecasted one generated through the persistence model of 0.59 ± 0.05,\\n0.63±0.08, 0.73±0.09 and 0.85±0.11. As is possible to note the persistence\\nmodel has less precision on the forecasting of the wind speed with respect to\\nour model and the standard deviation increases at the increasing of the time\\nscale in contrast to our model that has a reduction of the variability at the\\nincreasing of the time scale.\\n4.2. Number of data optimization\\nA serious problem to deal with in applying a nonparametric model is that\\nof data availability. An important point is that of establishing the dimension\\nof the setting period needed for a correct implementation of the model. From\\none part, reducing the setting period may determine the goodness of predic-\\ntion to drop down; on the other hand the availability of large database is\\ntime consuming and consequently not economically efficient and sometimes\\nnot statistically necessary. To fix this point as related to the ISMC model\\nwe computed the RMSE between real data and a forecasted time series of\\n1000 time horizon.\\nWe show, in Figure 4, the results obtained for the 30 minutes sampling\\nfrequency. It can be noted that the RMSE, plotted as a function of the\\nlogarithm of the setting period length, after about 3000 data (corresponding\\nroughly to 2 months) remains almost constant, suggesting that the use of\\na larger setting period is not necessary. We repeated the same analysis for\\nall the sampling frequency used obtaining: 20000 data (roughly 6 months)\\nfor 10 minutes sampling frequency, 2500 data (roughly 3 months) for 1 hour,\\nand 2000 (roughly 5 months) for 2 hours. The decreasing in the number of\\ndata need to have a good forecasting is mainly due to the reduction of noise\\nwhen the sampling frequency increases.\\n5. Discussion and conclusion\\nIn previous works we presented new stochastic models, all based on a\\nsemi-Markov approach, to generate synthetic time series of wind speed.

Using these\\nresults, here, we tried to apply the model which we recognized to be the\\nbest among those, namely the indexed semi-Markov chain (ISMC) model, to\\nforecast future wind speed in a specific site. The ISMC model is a nonpara-\\nmetric model and because of this it does not need any assumption on the\\ndistribution of wind speed and on wind speed variations.\\nIn previous papers we showed that the ISMC model is able to reproduce\\ncorrectly, and at the same time, both the probability distribution function of\\nwind speed and the autocorrelation function.\\nThe results presented in this paper show that the model can be efficiently\\nused to forecast wind speed at different horizon times. The forecast per-\\nformance is almost independent from the time horizon used to forecast; the\\nmodel can be used without degradation during the considered horizon time,\\nat different time scales (we showed this for time scales ranging from 10 min-\\nutes to 2 hours).\\nThe number of data needed to reach a good forecast performance do\\ndepend on the time scale used for forecasting; the model always works better\\nthan a simple persistence model.\\n12\\nAll these characteristics suggest that the advanced ISMC model may\\nbe used both for modeling wind speed data and for wind speed prediction.\\nTherefore, it may be utilized as input data for any wind energy system.\\nReferences\\nReferences\\n[1] Guoa Z, Zhaob W, Luc H, Wang J. 2012.

      "tion of a new site. Many researchers are working proposing new models that\n",
      "can allow the prediction of wind speed, minutes, hours or days ahead. Many\n",
      "of these models are based on neural networks [1, 2], autoregressive models\n",
      "[3, 4, 5], Markov chains [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], hybrid models where the previous\n",
      "mentioned models are combined [12, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,\n",
      "23, 24] and other less used models [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. Often, these models\n",
      "are either focused on speciﬁc time scale forecasting, or synthetic time series\n",
      "generation. Instead, our model can be used both for time series generation\n",
      "and for forecasting at diﬀerent time scales.\n",
      "The approach we propose here is based on indexed semi-Markov chain\n",
      "(ISMC) model that was advanced by the same authors in [31] and applied to\n",
      "the generation of synthetic wind speed time series. In [31] we showed that our\n",
      "model is able to reproduce correctly the statistical behavior of wind speed.\n",
      "The ISMC model is a nonparametric model because it does not require any\n",
      "assumption on the form of the distribution function of wind speed. In this\n",
      "work we use the same model, slightly modiﬁed by adding a daily deterministic\n",
      "component, to forecast future values of wind speed. We will show that this\n",
      "model performs better than a simple persistence model, by comparing the\n",
      "root mean square errors. The ISMC model is able to forecast wind speed\n",
      "at diﬀerent time scale without loosing the goodness of forecasting which\n",
      "is almost independent from the time horizon. Another important aspect\n",
      "addressed by this work is the number of data needed to have a good forecast.\n",
      "With this aim we will show the root mean square error as a function of the\n",
      "data used to calibrate the model.\n",
      "The paper is organized as follows. First of all, in Section 2, we describe\n",

      "results, here, we tried to apply the model which we recognized to be the\n",
      "best among those, namely the indexed semi-Markov chain (ISMC) model, to\n",
      "forecast future wind speed in a speciﬁc site. The ISMC model is a nonpara-\n",
      "metric model and because of this it does not need any assumption on the\n",
      "distribution of wind speed and on wind speed variations.\n",
      "In previous papers we showed that the ISMC model is able to reproduce\n",
      "correctly, and at the same time, both the probability distribution function of\n",
      "wind speed and the autocorrelation function.\n",
      "The results presented in this paper show that the model can be eﬃciently\n",
      "used to forecast wind speed at diﬀerent horizon times. The forecast per-\n",
      "formance is almost independent from the time horizon used to forecast; the\n",
      "model can be used without degradation during the considered horizon time,\n",
      "at diﬀerent time scales (we showed this for time scales ranging from 10 min-\n",
      "utes to 2 hours).\n",
      "The number of data needed to reach a good forecast performance do\n",
      "depend on the time scale used for forecasting; the model always works better\n",
      "than a simple persistence model.\n",
      "12All these characteristics suggest that the advanced ISMC model may\n",
      "be used both for modeling wind speed data and for wind speed prediction.\n",
      "Therefore, it may be utilized as input data for any wind energy system.\n",

In this paper we show a new nonparametricmodel, based on semi-Markov chains, to predict wind speed. Particularlywe use an indexed semi-Markov model, that reproduces accurately the sta-tistical behavior of wind speed, to forecast wind speed one step ahead fordiﬀerent time scales and for very long time horizon maintaining the good-ness of prediction. In order to check the main features of the model weshow, as indicator of goodness, the root mean square error between real dataand predicted ones and we compare our forecasting results with those of apersistence model.Keywords: Wind speed; forecasting model; indexed semi-Markov chains;1. IntroductionThe variations of wind speed, in a certain site, are strictly related to theeconomic aspects of a wind farm, such as maintenance operations, especiallyPreprint submitted to Renewable Energy May 17, 2013arXiv:1305.3696v1  [physics.data-an]  16 May 2013in the oﬀ shore farms, pitch angle control on new wind turbines and evalua-tion of a new site. Many researchers are working proposing new models thatcan allow the prediction of wind speed, minutes, hours or days ahead. Manyof these models are based on neural networks [1, 2], autoregressive models[3, 4, 5], Markov chains [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], hybrid models where the previousmentioned models are combined [12, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,23, 24] and other less used models [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. Often, these modelsare either focused on speciﬁc time scale forecasting, or synthetic time seriesgeneration. Instead, our model can be used both for time series generationand for forecasting at diﬀerent time scales.The approach we propose here is based on indexed semi-Markov chain(ISMC) model that was advanced by the same authors in [31] and applied tothe generation of synthetic wind speed time series. In [31] we showed that ourmodel is able to reproduce correctly the statistical behavior of wind speed.The ISMC model is a nonparametric model because it does not require anyassumption on the form of the distribution function of wind speed. In thiswork we use the same model, slightly modiﬁed by adding a daily deterministiccomponent, to forecast future values of wind speed. We will show that thismodel performs better than a simple persistence model, by comparing theroot mean square errors. The ISMC model is able to forecast wind speedat diﬀerent time scale without loosing the goodness of forecasting whichis almost independent from the time horizon. Another important aspectaddressed by this work is the number of data needed to have a good forecast.With this aim we will show the root mean square error as a function of thedata used to calibrate the model.The paper is organized as follows. First of all, in Section 2, we describethe database used for the analysis. In Section 3, we present the model and itsvalidation. Then, in Section 4, we present results of the wind speed forecast-ing through an indicator of goodness and comparison with the persistencemodel. Finally in Section 5 we present some concluding remarks.2. DatabaseThe database used for the analysis in this work is freely available from[37] and is composed of more than 230000 data of wind speed collected every10 minutes. The weather station of L.S.I. -Lastem is situated in Italy at N45 28’ 14,9” −E 9 22’ 19,9” and at 107 mof altitude. The station uses acombined speed-direction anemometer at 22 mabove the ground. It has a20 2 4 6 800.050.1v [m/s]Frequency25/10/2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 28/11/2011481216TimeWind speed [m/s]Figure 1: Database and its probability density distribution.measurement range that goes from 0 to 60 m/s, a threshold of 0,38 m/s anda resolution of 0,05 m/s. The database and its empirical probability densityfunction are represented in Figure 1. We discretized wind speed into 8 states(see Table 1) chosen to cover all the wind speed distribution. Table 1 showsthe wind speed states with their related wind speed values.In order to analyze the behavior at diﬀerent time scales, we resampledthe data at diﬀerent sampling frequencies: namely 30 minutes, 1 hour and 2hours.3. Model3.1. The indexed semi-Markov chain modelThe general formulation of the ISMC as developed in references [32], [33],[34] and [31] is here discussed informally.3Sate Wind speed range m/s1 0 to 12 1 - 23 2 - 34 3 - 45 4 - 56 5 - 67 6 - 78 >7Table 1: Wind speed discretizationSemi-Markov processes have similar idea as those that generate Markovprocesses. The processes are both described by a set of ﬁnite states vnwhosetransitions are ruled by a transition probability matrix. The semi-Markovprocess diﬀers from the Markov process because the transition times Tnaregenerated according to random variables. Indeed, the time between transi-tionsTn+1−Tnis random and may be modeled by means of any type ofdistribution functions. In studies concerning wind speed modeling the statesvnindicates discretized wind speed at the nth transition and Tnthe time inwhich the nth change of wind speed occurs.In [35, 36], diﬀerent semi-Markov models were applied to the wind speedmodeling and it was shown that the semi-Markov models over perform theMarkov models and therefore they are to be preferred in the modeling ofwind speed to Markovian models.In order to better represent the statistical characteristics of wind speed,in a recent article, the idea of an ISMC was advanced in the ﬁeld of windspeed, see [31]. The novelty, with respect to the semi-Markov case, consistsin the introduction of a third random variable deﬁned as follow:Umn=m∑k=0vn−1−k·Tn−k−Tn−1−kTn−Tn−1−m. (1)This variable can be interpreted as a moving average of order m+1 executedon the series of the past wind speed values ( vn−1−k) with weights given by thefractions of sojourn times in that wind speed ( Tn−k−Tn−1−k) with respectto the interval time on which the average is executed ( Tn−Tn−1−m). Also4SateUmrangem/s1 0 to 2.12 2.1 - 2.63 2.6 - 3.44 3.4 - 65>6Table 2: Umprocesses discretizationthe process Umhas been discretized, Table 2 shows the states of the processand their values.The parameter mmust be optimized as a function of the speciﬁc database.The optimization is made by ﬁnding the value of mthat realize the minimumof the root mean square error (RMSE) between the autocorrelation functions(ACF) of real and simulated data, see [31]. In our analysis m= 7.The reasons to introduce this index of memory are found in the presenceof a strong autocorrelation that characterize the wind speed process. In thesame work we have shown that if a too small memory is used, the autocor-relation is already persistent but decreases faster than real data. With alonger memory the autocorrelation remain high for a very long period andalso its value is very close to that of real data. If mis increased further theautocorrelation drops again to small values. This behavior suggests the exis-tence of an optimal memory m. In our opinion one can justify this behaviorby saying that short memories are not enough to identify in which status(low, medium low, medium, medium high, high, see Table 2) is the indexUm, too long memories mix together diﬀerent status and then much of theinformation is lost in the average.The one step transition probability matrix can be evaluated by consid-ering the counting transition between the three random variables consideredbefore. Then, the probability pi,j(t,u) represents the transition probabilityfrom the actual wind speed state i, to the wind speed state j, given that thesojourn time spent in the state iis equal to tand the value of the processUmisu. These probabilities can be computed as:pi,j(t,u) =ni,j(t,u)∑jni,j(t,u), (2)5wherenij(t,u) is the total number of transitions observed in the databasefrom stateito statejin next period having a sojourn time spent in the windspeediequal totand the value of the index process equal to u.The ISMC model revealed to be particularly eﬃcient in reproducing to-gether the probability density function of wind speed and the autocorrelationfunction, see [31].3.2. Deterministic wind speed componentThe speed of wind shows a diurnal behavior due to the alternation be-tween night and day. In Figure 2, in which are plotted the ACF of real andsimulated data, it is possible to note this sinusoidal trend (see Section 3.4for a better explanation of the ﬁgure). To model this seasonality we add adeterministic component given by a sine wave to the indexed semi-Markovmodel:vd=A·sin(2π24h)h= 1,2,...,n. (3)The value of the parameter Ahas to be optimized according to the databaseused for the analysis. In our case A= 0.41 and it has been obtained byminimizing the RMSE between the ACF of real and synthetic data by usinga genetic algorithm.3.3. Transition probability matrixWe computed the transition probability matrix by using equation (2)to the wind speed database. Two examples of the estimated matrices aregiven in Tables 3 and 4. As described above, in the model the transitionmatrix do depend from initial and arrival states but also from the sojourntime and the value of the random variable U. In the example given here weshow the transition matrices for Um= 2 andt= 2 and for Um= 4 andt= 2 respectively, evaluated from the original database with the samplingfrequency of 10 minutes.A ﬁrst comparison between Table 3 and Table 4 reveals that the value ofthe index process aﬀects seriously the transition probability to the next windspeed value. As a matter of example if i= 1,t= 2,Umn= 2, the probabilityto have a wind speed j= 1 in next period is equal to 0 .7065, see Table 3. Onthe contrary, if i= 1,t= 2,Umn= 4, the probability to have a wind speedj= 1 in next period becomes 0 .4900, see Table 4. The diﬀerences in the onestep transition probabilities are signiﬁcant and conﬁrm the hypothesis thatnext wind speed depends also on the value of the index process.

Model validationWe compute the ACF of real and synthetic data in order to assess theability of the model to reproduce statistical properties of real wind speeddata. We generate a synthetic time series by means of Monte Carlo simula-tion. The speciﬁc algorithm used for the generation of the trajectory can befound in [31]. If vindicates wind speed, the time lagged ( τ) autocorrelationof wind speed is deﬁned as:Σ(τ) =Cov(v(t+τ),v(t))Var(v(t)).

The ACFof real and the synthetic data are plotted in Figure 2. As it is possible tonote, the ACF has a sinusoidal trend with a period of 24 hours. This behavioris reproduced by our model with the introduction of the deterministic windspeed component evaluated by the equation (3 .2). To asses the diﬀerencesbetween the ACF of real and synthetic data we used the root mean squareerror (RMSE) which is deﬁned as follows:RMSE =\\ued6a\\ued6b\\ued6b√1nn∑i=1(vri−vsi)2,wherevrandvsrepresent real data and synthetic one respectively, while nis the length of the two series. For the ACF plotted in Figure 2 we obtaineda RMSE equal to 0 .0223.4. Results4.1. Wind speed forecastingIn this section the ISMC model is used to forecast future wind speedstates by using a one step ahead forecasting procedure, for diﬀerent time8horizons and for various time scales. Particularly, we tested our model usingthe previously described databases with a sampling frequency of 10 minutes,30 minutes, 1 hour and 2 hours.For each one of the sampling frequencies, the database is divided into twosubsets: the ﬁrst part is used to ﬁnd the transition probability matrix (asdescribed in the previous section), we will call this part the setting period;the second part is used to compare the model forecasting with real data(called testing period). As a ﬁrst attempt to verify the model performance,we used two years of data as setting period and one year as testing. We willshow in the paragraph 4.2 how to ﬁnd the best setting period. Once thetransition matrix is set, the forecasted states are computed as follows:vf=k∑j=1jpi,j(t,u), (5)wherekis the number of states in which wind speed is discretized and pi,j(t,u)is the transition probability matrix. The formula represents the expectedvalue of the next transition given that the present wind speed value is i, thesojourn time spent in the state iis equal to tand the value of the indexprocessUmisu.In Figure 3 we show the results obtained using our model for the fourdiﬀerent time scales. In the ﬁgure the black continuous line represents realdata while the dashed red line is the predicted series. In this ﬁgure thepredicted series are long 100 time horizon (speciﬁc time depending on thesampling frequency).Already from this ﬁgure, it is possible to note that the goodness of theprediction does not fall down at the increasing of the length of the forecastedseries. To better verify this point, in Table 5 we show quantitative results ofour forecasting model for all the considered time scales and for diﬀerent timehorizons. Particularly, we show mean and standard deviation of the RMSEbetween real and predicted data tested on 50 diﬀerent forecasted series. Table5 shows that the goodness of prediction remains almost constant even varyingtime scales and time horizons.We compare our model with a simple persistence model. This simplemethod is often used, still today, in industry for its simplicity and for itseﬃciency for very short-term predictions. It assumes that the wind speed attimet+ ∆tis equal to the wind speed at time t. Commonly this methodis used to compare the behavior of new forecasting models [38].

The persistence model do not change its goodness of forecasting atvarying of the time horizon. Then we compare our results with the persistencemodel at diﬀerent time scales. For the frequency of 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1hour and 2 hours we have respectively an RMSE between the true series andthe forecasted one generated through the persistence model of 0 .59±0.05,0.63±0.08, 0.73±0.09 and 0.85±0.11. As is possible to note the persistencemodel has less precision on the forecasting of the wind speed with respect toour model and the standard deviation increases at the increasing of the timescale in contrast to our model that has a reduction of the variability at theincreasing of the time scale.4.2. Number of data optimizationA serious problem to deal with in applying a nonparametric model is thatof data availability. An important point is that of establishing the dimensionof the setting period needed for a correct implementation of the model. Fromone part, reducing the setting period may determine the goodness of predic-tion to drop down; on the other hand the availability of large database istime consuming and consequently not economically eﬃcient and sometimesnot statistically necessary. To ﬁx this point as related to the ISMC modelwe computed the RMSE between real data and a forecasted time series of1000 time horizon.We show, in Figure 4, the results obtained for the 30 minutes samplingfrequency. It can be noted that the RMSE, plotted as a function of thelogarithm of the setting period length, after about 3000 data (correspondingroughly to 2 months) remains almost constant, suggesting that the use ofa larger setting period is not necessary. We repeated the same analysis forall the sampling frequency used obtaining: 20000 data (roughly 6 months)for 10 minutes sampling frequency, 2500 data (roughly 3 months) for 1 hour,and 2000 (roughly 5 months) for 2 hours. The decreasing in the number ofdata need to have a good forecasting is mainly due to the reduction of noisewhen the sampling frequency increases.5. Discussion and conclusionIn previous works we presented new stochastic models, all based on asemi-Markov approach, to generate synthetic time series of wind speed. Weshowed that all the models perform better than corresponding Markov chain111031040.60.811.21.41.6Number of dataRMSE [m/s]Figure 4: RMSE between real wind speed and forecasted series as a function of the loga-rithm of the number of data.based models in reproducing statistical features of wind speed. Using theseresults, here, we tried to apply the model which we recognized to be thebest among those, namely the indexed semi-Markov chain (ISMC) model, toforecast future wind speed in a speciﬁc site. The ISMC model is a nonpara-metric model and because of this it does not need any assumption on thedistribution of wind speed and on wind speed variations.In previous papers we showed that the ISMC model is able to reproducecorrectly, and at the same time, both the probability distribution function ofwind speed and the autocorrelation function.The results presented in this paper show that the model can be eﬃcientlyused to forecast wind speed at diﬀerent horizon times. The forecast per-formance is almost independent from the time horizon used to forecast; themodel can be used without degradation during the considered horizon time,at diﬀerent time scales (we showed this for time scales ranging from 10 min-utes to 2 hours).The number of data needed to reach a good forecast performance dodepend on the time scale used for forecasting; the model always works betterthan a simple persistence model.12All these characteristics suggest that the advanced ISMC model maybe used both for modeling wind speed data and for wind speed prediction.Therefore, it may be utilized as input data for any wind energy system.ReferencesReferences[1] Guoa Z, Zhaob W, Luc H, Wang J. 2012.
